# example-profiles.yaml
#
# DEPRECATED: This file format is deprecated in favor of workspace-based discovery.
#
# Ragbot now automatically discovers workspaces from your ragbot-data directory.
# Instead of maintaining this profiles.yaml file, you should:
#
# 1. Create a workspaces/ folder in your ragbot-data directory
# 2. Create a subfolder for each workspace (e.g., workspaces/my-project/)
# 3. Add a workspace.yaml file in each workspace folder
#
# Example workspace.yaml structure:
# ---
# name: My Project
# description: Description of this workspace
# status: active
# type: project
#
# inherits_from:
#   - parent-workspace  # Optional: inherit from another workspace
#
# include_from_root:
#   - runbooks/voice-and-style/       # Paths relative to ragbot-data root
#   - datasets/my-public-data/
# ---
#
# The workspace system provides:
# - Automatic discovery (no manual profile maintenance)
# - Inheritance between workspaces
# - Relative paths (portable across machines)
# - Clear organization (WHO/HOW/WHAT/WHERE framework)
#
# For more information, see the ragbot-data README.

# Legacy format (for reference only - will be ignored by new Ragbot versions):
profiles:
  - name: "Example Profile"
    instructions:
      - "/path/to/ragbot-data/instructions/example.md"
    datasets:
      - "/path/to/ragbot-data/datasets/example/"

  - name: "(none - dont use a profile)"
    instructions: []
    datasets: []
