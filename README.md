Ragbot.AI
=========

🤖 [Ragbot.AI (formerly named rbot)](https://github.com/rajivpant/ragbot): Rajiv's open source AI augmented brain assistant combines the power of large language models (LLMs) with [Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://ai.meta.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation-streamlining-the-creation-of-intelligent-natural-language-processing-models/) (RAG).

🚀 Ragbot.AI processes user prompts along with custom instructions and curated datasets, enabling context-aware responses. Powered by LLMs including OpenAI's GPT and Anthropic's Claude, Ragbot.AI uses RAG, a technique that combines the power of pre-trained dense retrieval and sequence-to-sequence models to generate more factual and informative text.

🧠 Custom instructions and curated datasets help Ragbot.AI better understand context, resulting in personalized, more accurate, and relevant responses, surpassing the capabilities of out of the box LLMs.

### Using curated dataset files

To use Ragbot.AI, you can provide curated dataset files and/or folders containing multiple curated dataset files. You can view examples of curated dataset files at <https://github.com/rajivpant/ragbot/tree/main/example-curated-datasets>

Example 1:

```console
rajivpant@RP-2021-MacBook-Pro ragbot % ./ragbot.py -d custom-instructions/ curated-datasets/public/ ../ragbot-private/curated-datasets/personal/ ../ragbot-private/curated-datasets/hearst -p "Write a short note in Rajiv's voice about Rajiv's job, coworkers, family members, and travel and food preferences for the person temporarily backfilling for his EA." 
curated datasets being used:
 - custom-instructions/
 - curated-datasets/public/travel-food.md
 - curated-datasets/public/employment-history.md
 - curated-datasets/public/about.md
 - curated-datasets/public/biography.md
 - ../ragbot-private/curated-datasets/personal/accounts.md
 - ../ragbot-private/curated-datasets/personal/contact-info.md
 - ../ragbot-private/curated-datasets/personal/personal-family.md
 - ../ragbot-private/curated-datasets/hearst/hearst.md
Using AI engine openai with model gpt-4
[redacted in this example]
```

Example 2:

```console
rajivpant@RP-2021-MacBook-Pro ragbot % ./ragbot.py -d custom-instructions/ curated-datasets/public/ -p "Write a short resume of Rajiv" 
curated datasets being used:
 - custom-instructions/
 - curated-datasets/public/travel-food.md
 - curated-datasets/public/employment-history.md
 - curated-datasets/public/about.md
 - curated-datasets/public/biography.md
Using AI engine openai with model gpt-4
[truncated in this example]
```

Example 3:

```console
./ragbot.py -p "Tell me a story about a brave knight and a wise wizard." -d curated datasets/story_characters
```

### Interactive mode

To use Ragbot.AI in interactive mode, use the `-i` or `--interactive` flag without providing a prompt via command line or input file. In this mode, you can enter follow-up prompts after each response.

Example:

```console
./ragbot.py -i -d curated-datasets/story_characters
```

In the first example, Ragbot.AI generates a short note in Rajiv's voice using the curated dataset files in the `../ragbot-private/curated-datasets` folder. In the second example, Ragbot.AI provides information on good practices for software development using the `curated-datasets/software_development.txt` curated dataset file. In the third example, Ragbot.AI tells a story about a brave knight and a wise wizard using the curated dataset files in the `curated-datasets/story_characters` folder.

### Using Ragbot.AI to suggest changes to its own code!

```console
rajivpant@RP-2021-MacBook-Pro ragbot % ./ragbot.py -d ragbot.py -p "if no curated dataset files are being used, then I want the code to show that."
curated datasets being used:
 - ragbot.py
Using AI engine openai with model gpt-4
To modify the code to show a message when no curated dataset files are being used, you can add an else statement after checking for the curated dataset files. Update the code in the `main()` function as follows:

\```python
if curated_dataset_files:
    print("curated datasets being used:")
    for file in curated_dataset_files:
        print(f" - {file}")
else:
    print("No curated dataset files are being used.")
\```

This will print "No curated dataset files are being used." when there are no curated dataset files detected.

```

### Examples of using with Linux/Unix pipes via the command line

Asking it to guess what some of the curated dataset files I use are for

```console
rajivpant@RP-2021-MacBook-Pro ragbot % find curated-datasets ../ragbot-private/curated-datasets -print | ./ragbot.py -d custom-instructions/ curated-datasets/public/ ../ragbot-private/curated-datasets/personal/ ../ragbot-private/curated-datasets/hearst/ -p "What do you guess these files are for?" 
curated datasets being used:
 - custom-instructions/
 - curated-datasets/public/travel-food.md
 - curated-datasets/public/employment-history.md
 - curated-datasets/public/about.md
 - curated-datasets/public/biography.md
 - ../ragbot-private/curated-datasets/personal/accounts.md
 - ../ragbot-private/curated-datasets/personal/contact-info.md
 - ../ragbot-private/curated-datasets/personal/personal-family.md
 - ../ragbot-private/curated-datasets/hearst/hearst.md
Using AI engine openai with model gpt-4
These files appear to be related to the curated-datasets of an AI system, likely for generating text or providing assistance based on the provided information. The files seem to be divided into two categories: public and private.

Public files:
- curated-datasets/public/travel-food.md: Rajiv's travel and food preferences
- curated-datasets/public/employment-history.md: Rajiv's employment history
- curated-datasets/public/about.md: General information about Rajiv
- curated-datasets/public/biography.md: Biography of Rajiv

Private files (stored in a separate private folder):
- curated-datasets/personal/accounts.md: Semi-private personal account information, such as frequent flyer numbers or loyalty programs. Does not contain any confidential or sensitive information.
- curated-datasets/personal/contact-info.md: Personal contact information, such as phone numbers and email addresses. Does not contain any confidential or sensitive information.
- curated-datasets/personal/personal-family.md: Personal and family information, such as family members and relationships. Does not contain any confidential or sensitive information.

Hearst-specific files:
- curated-datasets/hearst/hearst.md: Non-confidential, publicly available information related to the Hearst corporation, including Rajiv's role there

Overall, these files seem to contain various information about a person, their preferences, and professional background, likely used to tailor the AI system's responses and assistance.

Asking technical questions about a project

> ❗️ In the current version of Ragbot.AI, the --stdin and --prompt options are mutually exclusive, so the following example no longer works as is. In a future update to this README file, I will give an alternate example to obtain the similar results.
```console
alexredmon@ar-macbook ~/s/scribe > cat docker-compose.yml | ragbot --stdin -p "which services will be exposed on which ports by running all services in the following docker-compose.yml file?" 
In the given docker-compose.yml file, the following services are exposed on their respective ports:
1. "scribe" service: - Exposed on port 80 - Exposed on port 9009 (mapped to internal port 9009)
2. "scribe-feature" service: - Exposed on port 80
3. "scribe-redis" service: - Exposed on port 6379 (mapped to internal port 6379)
