"""Substrate-level Pydantic models for synthesis-engineering runtimes.

These types are produced by code in this package — workspace discovery,
the engines.yaml-backed model registry, and future indexing helpers.
Runtimes consume these types directly: `from synthesis_engine.models
import WorkspaceInfo` (or `ModelInfo`, etc.).

Runtime-specific API request/response shapes (chat requests, index requests,
config responses) do NOT belong here. They live in the runtime package
that owns the HTTP/CLI surface they describe.
