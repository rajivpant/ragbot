"""Cross-workspace synthesis driver — backbone of the ``cross-workspace-synthesis`` skill.

The skill (``starter_pack/cross-workspace-synthesis/SKILL.md``) declares a
``cross_workspace_synthesize`` tool. The LLM uses the tool declaration as
the orchestration shape: it produces a tool-call with workspaces + query
+ budget, the runtime dispatches the call to
:func:`run_cross_workspace_synthesis`, and the structured
:class:`SynthesisReport` comes back as the tool's result.

The driver lives outside ``starter_pack/`` because it is Python code, not
skill content: skill directories carry SKILL.md + references + scripts,
and ``starter_pack/`` is the canonical location for those. The driver is
the Python substrate the runtime hooks the skill's tool name to.

Design notes
------------

* **Single function, not a class.** The driver is one entry point with
  pure arguments. Tests mock the dependencies directly; production wires
  the real Memory + LLMBackend.

* **Async signature.** The agent loop is async; making this entry point
  ``async def`` lets callers ``await`` it inside that loop without a
  thread shim. The actual work is CPU-bound (LLM call + retrieval), and
  both the LLMBackend.complete and three_tier_retrieve_multi calls are
  sync — we run them directly inside the async function.

* **Confidentiality gate first, retrieval second.** The driver checks the
  cross-workspace boundary BEFORE retrieving any blocks. A denied op
  never reads any workspace's content. The audit entry records the
  attempt regardless of outcome.

* **Audit on every path.** Success, confidentiality denial, retrieval
  failure, and LLM failure all write an :class:`AuditEntry`. The on-disk
  audit log is the forensic surface; if the operation produced any
  side-effect (including the LLM call), the audit log records it.

* **Errors over silent degradation.** When the confidentiality gate
  denies the op, the driver raises :class:`ConfidentialityError`. When
  the LLM returns malformed output, the driver returns a SynthesisReport
  carrying the raw text in ``summary`` and an empty findings list — the
  operator sees the failure mode rather than a fabricated success.
