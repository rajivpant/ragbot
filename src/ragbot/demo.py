"""Demo-mode helpers.

When ``RAGBOT_DEMO=1`` (or ``true``/``yes``), ragbot:

* Discovers exactly one workspace — the bundled ``demo/ai-knowledge-demo/`` —
  and ignores everything else (the user's ``~/.synthesis/console.yaml``,
  the ``~/workspaces/*/ai-knowledge-*`` glob, legacy flat parents).
* Discovers exactly one skill root — the bundled ``demo/skills/`` —
  and ignores ``~/.synthesis/skills``, ``~/.claude/skills``, and plugin
  caches.
* Reports ``demo_mode: true`` from ``/health`` and ``/api/config`` so the
  Web UI can render an unmistakable banner.

The motivation is twofold: an evaluator can run ``ragbot --demo`` and
see ragbot work end-to-end without setup, and a maintainer can capture
screenshots without any risk that a real workspace name leaks into the
frame.
