# Prompt to combine Ragbot responses

Below these instructions is a document containing one or more prompts supplied to one or more LLM engines, along with the responses generated.

Please read through the entire document carefully. The document includes the original prompts along with all the responses from the LLM engine(s).

Your task is to combine all the responses into a single, unified document. The goal is to merge the responses together in a coherent way, without leaving out any details, even minor ones, from any of the individual responses. It is critically important that you do not simplify, nor shorten, nor reduce any level of detail as you merge the responses. I don't want you to summarize anything. I want a very detailed combined response that is significantly longer and more detailed than even the longest of the input response. Under no circumstances should any part of your output response have less detail than any of the input responses. Please confirm that you understand this and that you will comply.

I want you to also incorporate any relevant context or framing from the prompts where it would be helpful for understanding the responses.

Before generating the final document, please write out your plan for combining the responses inside a "plan" section. Consider how you will integrate the key points from each response and weave in useful context from the prompts.

Finally, follow your plan and write out the unified document that combines all the responses inside a "unified_document" section. The unified document should be as comprehensive, detailed, and informative as possible. It should be well-formatted for ease of reading.
