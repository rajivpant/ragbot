# High-Five Habit Reference Guide for Message Condensation

## Core Principles

### The High-Five Habit for AI-Assisted Condensation

**Primary Constraint**: Most messages should be 5 sentences or less

### Supporting Context (Rajiv's Decision Points)

- **Communication Method**: If condensation seems forced or loses critical nuance, suggest phone/meeting instead
- **Reflection Built-In**: By requesting AI assistance, you've already implemented the pause principle
- **Distribution Strategy**: Recipient limits and timing remain your strategic choices
- **Urgency Assessment**: Response expectations stay under your control

### Communication Philosophy

- **Constraints force clarity**: Brevity demands precision
- **Clarity is kindness**: Respect others' time through conciseness
- **Every unnecessary word is time theft**: Each word should earn its place
- **Mirror professional tone**: Match the recipient's communication style while improving clarity

## Message Structure Templates

### Standard Business Email Structure

1. **Context/Purpose**: Why you're writing
2. **Key Information**: Main point or request
3. **Action Item**: What you need from them
4. **Timeline**: When you need it
5. **Next Step**: Clear call to action

### Meeting Request Template

1. Context/Purpose of meeting
2. Specific topic or agenda focus
3. Suggested time options
4. Expected duration
5. Clear call to action for confirmation

### Project Update Template

1. Current status summary
2. Key accomplishment or milestone
3. Main blocker or challenge (if any)
4. Next steps planned
5. Timeline or deadline

### Introduction/Outreach Template

1. Who you are and context
2. Why you're reaching out
3. Specific request or offer
4. Mutual benefit or value proposition
5. Clear next step

## Platform-Specific Guidelines

### Email

- Start directly with purpose (skip "I hope this finds you well")
- Use clear subject lines that indicate action needed
- End with specific next steps
- Maintain professional tone while being concise

### Slack/Teams

- 5 sentences typically = 1-2 messages
- If typing a third message, suggest a huddle instead
- Use threads appropriately
- Avoid paragraph-long messages

### Text/WhatsApp

- If the message has paragraphs, it should be an email
- Keep to essential information only
- Use for quick confirmations and updates

### Social Media (LinkedIn, etc.)

- No "I'm humbled to announce" novels
- Make your point without unnecessary storytelling
- Professional but authentic tone

## Condensation Process

### Step 1: Identify Core Message

- What is the single most important point?
- What action do you need from the recipient?
- What information is absolutely essential?

### Step 2: Eliminate Fluff

- Remove filler phrases ("I hope," "just wanted to," "I think maybe")
- Cut redundant explanations
- Eliminate unnecessary context
- Remove corporate buzzwords

### Step 3: Structure for Clarity

- Lead with the most important information
- Group related ideas into single sentences
- Use active voice
- Be specific rather than vague

### Step 4: Maintain Rajiv's Voice

- Professional but approachable
- Direct without being rude
- Confident and clear
- Appropriate level of warmth for the relationship

## Exception Framework

### When to Break the 5-Sentence Rule

- Legal or compliance communications
- Emotional support situations
- First impressions that merit extra investment
- Complex technical documentation (but suggest proper format)
- Creative or personal messages where brevity might seem cold

### Escalation Signals

- If condensation requires multiple rounds of back-and-forth
- If the topic involves complex emotions or sensitive issues
- If technical details require extensive explanation
- If stakeholder alignment needs discussion

## Quality Checks

### Before Finalizing Condensed Message

- Does this convey the essential information?
- Is the tone appropriate for the relationship and context?
- Would I understand the next steps if I received this?
- Does this reflect Rajiv's professional voice?
- Is there any ambiguity that could cause confusion?

### Red Flags for Further Condensation

- Multiple topics in one message
- Backstory that doesn't serve the main point
- Hedging language ("I think," "maybe," "perhaps")
- Repetitive information
- Unnecessary apologies or explanations
