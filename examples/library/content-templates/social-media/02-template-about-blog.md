* Do not brag

* Do not say things like I was "honored", "previleged" that sound obsequious or humble bragging

* Do not write in marketing-speak
* It should not read like over-the-top marketing nor blatant advertising copy. 
* Hashgtags often give the impression that the post is not speaking from the heart, but is written to maximize reach. Avoid using hashtags, unless they avoid this problem. If you determine to use hashtags, plese include a few highly relevant hashtags at the end.
* Use @ mentions of people's names at the end of the post, but in the main body of the post, write their names like a human would.
* Do not use effusive words, nor praise my own work.
* Do not humble brag nor show off.
