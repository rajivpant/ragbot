Please write social media posts for me. The posts must be written with the primary goal of accomplishing the purpose I have described here. Pay careful attention to all the instructions in this prompt. Before you write the posts, explain not only what my purpose and desired outcomes are, but improve on them. Then recap the instructions I have given you. Then show me your plan to meet my purpose, follow my instructions, and write the most effective social media posts for me. Finally, show me the posts you have written.
The instructions in the how-to-write and how-not-to-write sections only apply to the text of the social media posts you write for me, not to the rest of your response. For example, in answering my questions, you can be as verbose as you need to be.
