# Social Media Templates

Reusable templates for creating social media content across platforms with consistent voice and strategic positioning.

## Core Philosophy

All templates in this folder follow a common philosophy:
- **Authentic over promotional:** Content should feel genuine, not like marketing
- **Substance over style:** Focus on insights and value, not just visibility
- **Strategic subtlety:** Demonstrate expertise without claiming it explicitly
- **Platform-appropriate:** Adapt format and tone to each platform's norms

## Style Guidelines

**Universal Anti-Patterns (Apply to All Templates):**
- No "honored," "privileged," "excited," "thrilled"
- No humble bragging or obvious self-promotion
- No marketing-speak or corporate jargon
- No excessive emojis (use sparingly if at all)
- No forced hashtags (use only when organic)
- Avoid being star-struck or putting yourself down

**Platform-Specific Considerations:**

**LinkedIn:**
- Professional but approachable tone
- Focus on career/business relevance
- Can be slightly longer (300-500 words)
- @ mentions go at the end

**Twitter/X:**
- Concise and conversational
- Consider thread format for complex topics
- Natural language, avoid marketing tone
- @ mentions at end of thread

**Instagram:**
- Visual-first (even for text posts)
- More personal, warm tone acceptable
- Can be more casual than LinkedIn
- @ mentions at end

## Usage Patterns

**Before Using Any Template:**
1. Read through the entire template to understand its structure
2. Fill in all XML-tagged sections (`<event>`, `<context>`, `<purpose>`, etc.)
3. Review the `<how-not-to-write>` section carefully
4. Ensure you have any required URLs or usernames

**After AI Generates Content:**
1. Review against the anti-patterns
2. Check that it doesn't sound robotic or formulaic
3. Verify all @ mentions and URLs are correct
4. Read it aloud to ensure it sounds like you
5. Edit ruthlessly to remove any AI-typical phrasing

## Customization

**Adapting for Your Voice:**
All templates can be customized with:
- Your specific writing style preferences
- Industry-specific considerations
- Relationship context with mentioned people
- Current events or trending topics relevant to your content

**Template Variables:**
Common variables across templates:
- `<event>` - What happened or what you're announcing
- `<location>` - Where it occurred
- `<context>` - Background information
- `<purpose>` - Your strategic objectives
- `<tips>` - Specific considerations for this instance
- `<relevant-data>` - Usernames, URLs, hashtags
