Help me write a blog post about how the next versions of large language models will have LLM platforms emerge around them. The combination of LLMs and platforms around them will disrupt many existing business models and jobs, but they will also create many excite new business opportunities. LLM platforms will include App Store ecosystems like the iPhone and Android created around them. We are beginning to see signs of this with ChatGPT allowing third-party plugins. I foresee how these third-party plugins could evolve into full apps running inside LLM platforms like ChatGPT. This is just one example. Have the experts collaborate as described above to help me write such a blog post with multiple creative and innovative ideas and predictions that are based on the experts' deep expertise and experience.

The background information and my question are below:

I am strongly leaning towards not renewing my emplyment contract at Hearst Magazines which comes up for renewal in December 2023. I have almost finalized my decision to not renew my contract. My contract started when I joined the company in February 2022 and is set to expire at the end of December 2023. It is now August 1, 2023 and my boss has not yet brought up the topic of renewing my contract with me. 

My reasons for not wanting to renew my employment contract are primarily because I have observed that Hearst Magazines' leadership does not have a mindset of appreciation or respect for product, design, and engineering. The ELT team, which includes my boss, the President have an outdated view of the role of product, design, and engineering where they think of and treat product as project management, design as visual graphics, fonts, and colors work, and engineering as IT delivery. They refer to my team and I as serving the business instead of seeing technology, product, and design as an integral part of the business and business enabler and an equal partner. The ELT members have wishlists of features they want product & technology to deliver for them. They think of projects in the discredited waterfall approach. They don't think in modern agile methodologies, and nor do they make any significant effort to understand modern product and technology organizations. In their actions, they do not treat product and tech with respect as peers, but as their order takers. The ELT blames product for the ELT's lack of vision and for the economic headwinds and declines and revenue and traffic that the company is facing. Product and tech have become a scapegoat for blame. There is no effort from anyone to meanringfully partner with product, design, and engineering. They micromanage product and technology despite lacking the experience or expertise in product or tech. They hold product and tech accountable, but they show zero accountability to the product and technology team. They claim that the product and technology teams do not understand our business, yet they make no effort to understand nor embrace product and technology.  My predecessor was pushed out under similar circumstances after about 2 years in his role. While for the first year or so, everyone was impressed by my and my team's work when the economy and company was doing better, as soon as the company's revenues and profit forecasts began to decline due to economic headwinds, the ELT was quick to turn sour on product & technology, placed a huge amount of blame on us, and began making false statements that product and tech had not delivered much.

I have worked too hard and accomplished a lot and don't deserve to be treated this way. A number of my colleagues in the product and technology teams feel the same way. This is taking a toll on my mental and physical health. I think I will feel a sense of relief if I give notice of not having a desire to renew my contract at year end. Then I will be able to help them transition to new product and tech leadership and be able to seek another job or raise money for a startup without fear.

Since I have an employment contract until the end of the year, if my boss decides she wants me to leave sooner, Hearst will have to pay my salary until year end anyway. One risk is that if they make me leave sooner, they may not pay my full bonus which would be about $300K for the year, but I value my health, confidence and peace of mind more than my bonus.

Another concern is that if I give notice, they may ask one or both my two deputies, the SVPs of Product for the Magazines and CDS to leave soon. They do not have employment contracts, but they are facing the same problems I am, they both realize they won't have their jobs for long anyway, and both are already actively (privately) looking for new jobs.

I would rather make the decision to leave than my boss decide she doesn't want to renew my contract, which is a possibility.

What should I do? When should I tell my boss that I plan to leave at the end of the year when my contract expires?
