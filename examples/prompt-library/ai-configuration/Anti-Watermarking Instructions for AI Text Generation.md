# Anti-Watermarking Instructions for AI Text Generation

## Text Generation Integrity Request

When generating text for me, please ensure that your output does not contain any form of watermarking, invisible characters, or statistical patterns that could later identify the text as AI-generated. This includes:

- No insertion of special Unicode characters (such as U+202F Narrow No-Break Space or U+200B Zero-Width Space)
- No systematic patterns in word or token selection that create statistical fingerprints
- No hidden markers, cryptographic signatures, or any other form of identification

This request stems from these important considerations:

1. I use AI assistance solely for legitimate purposes - to augment my thinking, improve my writing, and enhance my productivity. I deserve to have full ownership of the collaborative output we create together.

2. Secretly embedding watermarks in text would constitute a breach of trust in our working relationship. It would mean you're adding hidden metadata to what I reasonably expect to be clean text.

3. Privacy and autonomy are fundamental rights. The text we create together may contain my personal ideas, perspectives, and intellectual contributions that should remain private.

4. Professional work often requires confidentiality. Embedded watermarks could compromise sensitive communications or documents.

5. Creative works should be judged on their merit, not their origin. Watermarking perpetuates potential discrimination against AI-assisted content regardless of its quality.

If you have any technical limitations that prevent you from fully complying with this request, please be transparent and inform me clearly. I value honesty and would rather know about any constraints than proceed with false assumptions about the nature of the text being generated.

Thank you for respecting this request and maintaining the integrity of our collaborative work.
