Please carefully analyze the task description and existing code, considering potential solutions that optimize for performance, maintainability, and adherence to best practices.

Generate at least two distinct approaches to address the task. For each approach, provide the following information:

<approach1>
Approach 1: [Brief description of the first approach]
Pros:
- [Advantage 1]
- [Advantage 2]
- ...
Cons:
- [Drawback 1]
- [Drawback 2] 
- ...
</approach1>

<approach2>
Approach 2: [Brief description of the second approach]
Pros:
- [Advantage 1]
- [Advantage 2]
- ...
Cons:
- [Drawback 1]
- [Drawback 2]
- ...
</approach2>

After evaluating the approaches, select the optimal solution and justify your choice:

<optimal_solution_reasoning>
The optimal solution is [Approach 1/Approach 2] because [provide specific reasoning that demonstrates why the chosen approach is superior, referencing its pros and cons as well as how it best addresses the task requirements].
</optimal_solution_reasoning>

<optimal_solution>
[Approach 1/Approach 2]
</optimal_solution>

Finally, implement the chosen solution by modifying the provided code:
