# Universal Hyperlink Research Template

## Purpose and Instructions

This template is designed to help you gather hyperlinks for blog posts, articles, presentations, or any content where you need to reference people, organizations, or other entities. You can use it in two ways:

1. **Submit unmodified**: Submit this entire template as-is, and the AI will ask you for the names and entities you need links for
2. **Fill in your needs**: Replace the example entries with your specific entities and their descriptions

The structure guides the AI to find the most authoritative and current links, prioritizing official websites over social media when appropriate.

# Hyperlink Research Request

I need to find accurate hyperlinks for people, organizations, and entities mentioned in my content. Please help me locate the most authoritative and current links available.

## People to Research

[AI ASSISTANT NOTE: If no people are listed below this line, please ask the user which people they need links for. Otherwise, research the people listed.]

Examples (replace with your people or leave as-is):
- Person Name - Brief description of their role, affiliation, or why they're mentioned
- Another Person - Notable achievements, position, or identifying details

## Organizations and Entities

[AI ASSISTANT NOTE: If no organizations are listed below this line, please ask the user which organizations they need links for. Otherwise, research the organizations listed.]

Examples (replace with your organizations or leave as-is):
- Organization Name - What they do, where they're based, or why they're relevant
- Another Organization - Industry, significance, or distinguishing features

## Link Prioritization

For people, please prioritize links in this order:
1. Personal/professional website
2. Institutional/company profile
3. LinkedIn profile
4. Other professional social media (Twitter/X, etc.)

For organizations, please prioritize:
1. Official website
2. Primary social media presence if no website exists
3. Authoritative third-party profile (Wikipedia, Bloomberg, etc.) if no official presence exists

## Required Output Format

Please provide the results in HTML format that I can easily copy-paste:

```html
<!-- People -->
<a href="URL">Person Name</a>
<a href="URL">Another Person</a>

<!-- Organizations -->
<a href="URL">Organization Name</a>
<a href="URL">Another Organization</a>
```

If you cannot find a link for any specific entity, please note that and suggest alternatives. For example: "Could not find official page for X, consider linking to their LinkedIn profile or recent interview at [URL]."

For especially common names or ambiguous entities, please confirm the context matches what I'm looking for before providing the final links.

Thank you for your help with this research task!

## Tips for Getting the Best Results

When using this template, consider these recommendations:

1. **Add context for ambiguous names**: For people with common names, include distinguishing details like their company, field of expertise, or location to ensure the correct person is identified.

2. **Specify link recency**: If you need particularly current links, explicitly request the most recent official websites.

3. **Request verification**: For particularly important links, ask the AI to provide a brief confirmation that the link is still active and matches the entity you're looking for.

4. **Group related entities**: If you're writing about a specific industry or event, group your requests by category to help the AI understand the context better.

5. **Regional preferences**: If you need links to region-specific versions of websites, mention this requirement explicitly.
