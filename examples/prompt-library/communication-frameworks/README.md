# Communication Frameworks

Principles, methodologies, and guidelines for effective communication across different channels and contexts.

## Purpose

This folder contains frameworks that guide communication strategy and execution. Unlike templates (which provide specific formats), these frameworks establish principles and decision-making processes for communication.

## Contents
