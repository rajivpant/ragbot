## v3.5.0 — 2026-05-15

Substrate cleanup. Pgvector is the only vector backend, the agent loop
wires at startup, OTLP metric and trace export are independently
configurable, app loggers surface under uvicorn, and the regression
suite no longer fails on dev machines without heavy ML dependencies.
Breaking change: `RAGBOT_VECTOR_BACKEND=qdrant` and the bundled Qdrant
backend are removed. Operators who ran v3.4 with the Qdrant opt-in
must reindex their workspaces into pgvector before upgrading.

### Removed

- **Qdrant vector backend.** Deleted `synthesis_engine.vectorstore.QdrantBackend`,
  the embedded `qdrant_data/` storage path, the `qdrant-client` dependency,
  the `RAGBOT_VECTOR_BACKEND` environment variable, and the `ragbot-qdrant`
  Docker volume. Dead `_qdrant_client` / `_get_qdrant_client` /
  `get_qdrant_point_id` helpers in `rag.py` and `chunking/` removed.
  The `VectorStore` ABC at `synthesis_engine.vectorstore` is retained so
  substrate consumers outside Ragbot can plug in alternative backends
  behind the same contract.

### Changed

- **Agent loop wires at startup.** The FastAPI lifespan now constructs an
  `AgentLoop` with the lifespan's LLM backend, the resolved MCP client, and
  a `FilesystemCheckpointStore`, then calls
  `api.routers.agent.set_default_loop()` to register the singleton. The
  `/api/agent/run` endpoint resolves against a real loop on a fresh install
  — through v3.4 it returned `"Agent loop is not configured"`. Shutdown
  clears the singleton.
- **OTLP metric export is independently configurable.** The substrate now
  honours the OTEL standard per-signal env-var hierarchy:
  `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_ENDPOINT` (per-signal override; accepts the
  literal `"none"` to disable metric OTLP export) falls back to
  `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`. The bundled docker-compose stack sets the
  metrics endpoint to `"none"` because Jaeger only accepts traces — the
  `UNIMPLEMENTED` errors from earlier deployments are gone. Prometheus
  exposition at `/api/metrics` is unaffected.
- **App loggers surface under uvicorn.** `src/api/main.py` calls
  `logging.basicConfig` at module-import time before uvicorn takes over,
  so `api.main`, `api.routers.*`, and `synthesis_engine.*` log lines now
  flow to `docker logs ragbot-api` alongside uvicorn's own access logs.
  Override the level with `RAGBOT_LOG_LEVEL`.
- **`get_vector_store()` returns `None` when pgvector is unreachable**
  instead of falling back through a backend chain. Callers in `rag.py`
  treat `None` as "RAG unavailable; chat-only mode," so the user-facing
  failure mode is graceful.

### Fixed

- **`/api/agent/run` returns 503 "not configured"** — fixed by the agent
  loop wiring change above.
- **OTLP metric export prints `UNIMPLEMENTED`** — fixed by the per-signal
  endpoint split.
- **App-namespace logger lines invisible in container logs** — fixed by
  `logging.basicConfig` in `src/api/main.py`.
- **`test_sentence_transformers_imports_cleanly` fails on dev machines
  without sentence_transformers installed** — wrapped both Bug5
  regression tests in `pytest.importorskip("sentence_transformers")` so
  they skip cleanly on lightweight dev installs and still run in Docker /
  CI where the dependency is present.

### Test-suite delta

- v3.4.0 baseline: 871 passing, 25 skipped, 4 failing (3 Qdrant tests + 1
  sentence_transformers env gap).
- v3.5.0: 850 passing, 14 skipped, 0 failing (Qdrant tests gone with the
  backend; sentence_transformers tests skip cleanly).

## v3.4.0 — 2026-05-14

Ragbot becomes the conversational reference runtime of synthesis engineering.

v3.4 is the next-major-features release for Ragbot. It moves the project
from a polished 2024-paradigm chat-with-RAG product to a 2026-shaped
conversational AI runtime: explicit agent loop, first-class MCP in both
directions, an executable skills runtime, cross-workspace synthesis with
visible confidentiality boundaries, durable memory beyond vector RAG,
and the production-grade signals (observability, replay, eval harness,
background tasks, scheduled routines) that make the architecture legible
to engineering leadership. The synthesis-engineering positioning that the
architecture had quietly named for a year is now visible in the README,
the ragbot.ai homepage, and the in-product chrome.

### Headliners

**Agent loop runtime.** Ragbot is now an execution surface, not just a
chat surface. A hand-rolled graph-state agent loop replaces the
single-turn `prompt → retrieve → call LLM → return` path. The agent can
decide between answering directly, dispatching retrieval, calling a
tool, running a skill, or fanning out to sub-agents. Plan-and-Execute is
the default compound-question pattern with explicit replanning on
failure. Permission gates fail closed at the tool boundary. State
checkpoints are durable and replayable. The chat-only no-tools mode
remains available for users who want it.

**First-class MCP — client and server.** As a client, Ragbot covers all
six MCP primitives (tools, resources, prompts, Roots, Sampling,
Elicitation) and supports MCP Tasks for long-running calls. As a server,
Ragbot exposes workspace search, document retrieval, skill execution,
and audit recent as MCP tools and resources so Claude Code, Cursor,
ChatGPT desktop, and other MCP-aware clients can call into Ragbot's
knowledge surface. OAuth 2.1 with Dynamic Client Registration is
supported for remote servers; bearer-token auth and per-token
`allowed_tools` glob filtering are supported on the server side.

**Skills as runtime.** `SKILL.md` is now Ragbot's native extensibility
format with progressive disclosure (names + descriptions in the system
prompt, full body on selection, scripts and templates on tool call).
Skills written for Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor, or Gemini CLI run on
Ragbot without modification. Six starter skills ship in the box:
`workspace-search-with-citations`, `draft-and-revise`,
`fact-check-claims`, `summarize-document`, `agent-self-review`, and
`cross-workspace-synthesis`. The `npx skills add
synthesisengineering/synthesis-skills` install path turns the 32 public
synthesis-skills into runnable capabilities, not just searchable
content.

**Synthesis ecosystem positioning and rebrand.** Ragbot is officially
the reference runtime for the conversational interaction primitive
inside synthesis engineering, with sibling reference implementations
covering direct manipulation (synthesis-console), procedural execution
(Ragenie), and the portable capability format (synthesis-skills). The
README hero, the ragbot.ai homepage, the in-product footer chrome, and
`llms.txt` all lead with the synthesis framing. Vermillion (#b8312f) is
Ragbot's accent ink in the historical-inks palette of the synthesis
family, joining Prussian blue (synthesis-engineering), iron-gall green
(synthesis-coding), walnut brown (synthesis-writing), and lapis
ultramarine (Ragenie).

**Cross-workspace synthesis.** Multi-workspace chat is now first-class.
Select 2+ workspaces in the UI; the agent sees a per-workspace context
budget and per-workspace confidentiality tag. Per-workspace
`routing.yaml` governs which models can be called for each workspace
(local-only for `client-confidential`, frontier for `personal`, and so
on). Every cross-workspace operation is logged to an append-only audit
trail with timestamp, workspaces involved, tools called, and model
used. The `cross-workspace-synthesize` starter skill walks the agent
through per-workspace budget math, the four-level confidentiality
strictness order with pairwise mix table, and the
`[workspace:document_id]` citation format.

### Production-grade signals

- **Memory beyond RAG.** A three-layer memory stack: vector RAG over
  pgvector (existing), entity-graph memory with provenance and temporal
  validity (new `nodes` and `edges` tables), and session/working memory
  (per-user persistent prefs and in-flight context). A consolidation
  pass between sessions distills durable facts from the previous
  session and writes them into the entity graph. Pluggable: Mem0 and
  Letta integrations available as optional swap-ins behind the
  abstraction.
- **MCP server.** `synthesis_engine.mcp_server` exposes Ragbot via both
  stdio (for desktop integrations) and HTTP/SSE (via
  `StreamableHTTPSessionManager`) transports. Per-token `allowed_tools`
  glob filtering and bearer-token auth configured via
  `~/.synthesis/mcp-server.yaml`. Five exposed tools: `workspace_search`,
  `workspace_search_multi` (confidentiality gate fires before retrieval),
  `document_get`, `skill_run`, `agent_run_start`. Three exposed
  resources: workspaces, skills, audit-recent.
- **Replay CLI.** `ragbot agent replay <task_id>` deterministically
  re-runs a session from any checkpoint, with `--show-trace` and
  `--save-output` flags. `ragbot agent list-sessions` and `ragbot agent
  checkpoints <task_id>` for inspection. A stable hash over
  `{current_state, final_answer, step_results}` (timestamps excluded)
  gates regression detection.
- **Eval regressions.** `tests/evals/regressions/` captures canonical
  bug shapes (sub-agent dispatch max-parallel, disabled sandbox
  actionable error, permission deny blocks tool, cross-workspace
  air-gapped isolation, replay determinism canary). `make eval` runs the
  full eval suite with a scorecard renderer.
- **Background tasks.** `synthesis_engine.tasks` provides a
  `BackgroundTaskManager` with JSONL persistence at
  `~/.synthesis/tasks/{id}.jsonl`, cooperative cancellation
  (`TaskCancelled` raised at safe points; no force-kill), crash recovery
  on startup, webhook delivery per-task, and three notifier adapters
  (macOS via `osascript`, email via SMTP, Slack via MCP). A scheduler is
  opt-in via `RAGBOT_SCHEDULER=1`, reading `~/.synthesis/schedules.yaml`.
- **Keyboard shortcuts.** A coherent shortcut layer covers the 2026
  expected interactions: ⌘K (model picker), ⌘J (workspace switch), ⌘/
  (message history search), ⌘N (new chat), ⌘B (background current run),
  ⌘. (cancel), ⌘? (help overlay with focus trap and Escape close).
  Platform-aware key matching (Meta on macOS, Ctrl elsewhere); strict
  exact-modifier matching so ⌘⌥K doesn't accidentally fire ⌘K.
- **Observability.** OpenTelemetry traces by default with semantic
  GenAI attributes on every model call, retrieval step, guardrail
  check, and tool dispatch. `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` ships traces
  to Phoenix, Langfuse, Datadog, or Honeycomb. Prometheus exposition at
  `/api/metrics` and cache-stats JSON at `/api/metrics/cache`. Prompt
  caching with `cache_control` annotations on the static system-prompt
  prefix.

### Open-weights additions

`engines.yaml` adds the four open-weights families that became serious
local agent defaults in 2026:

- **Llama 4** (Meta) — sizes documented in the new sizing matrix at
  [`docs/open-weights-sizing.md`](docs/open-weights-sizing.md).
- **Qwen3** (Alibaba) — the practical local agent default; 27B size is
  the recommended balance of capability and footprint on Apple Silicon
  with the MLX backend.
- **DeepSeek-V3** — strong reasoning at competitive sizes.
- **Mistral Large** — Mistral's open-weights flagship.

Updated **Gemma 4** entries with notes on the Ollama 0.19 MLX backend
(~2x decode speedup on Apple Silicon). The full sizing matrix maps
model families to recommended hardware tiers (laptop, prosumer desktop,
Mac Studio-class, workstation), VRAM/unified-memory requirements, and
target inference profiles.

### Breaking changes

v3.4 is the next-major-features release. Breaking changes are
intentional and visible. If you are upgrading from v3.3, the items
below require migration steps.

- **`synthesis_engine` is now a public substrate library.** The runtime
  code under `src/synthesis_engine/` is the supported import surface for
  building synthesis-engineering products on top of Ragbot's primitives.
  `src/ragbot/` is now ragbot-runtime-specific code only. Imports under
  `from ragbot.X` for substrate types have moved to `from
  synthesis_engine.X`. The `RagbotError` exception base class has been
  renamed to `SynthesisError` across the substrate; all five subclasses
  are renamed correspondingly.
- **`routing.yaml` is a new per-workspace convention.** Each workspace
  may declare a `routing.yaml` at its root with
  `allowed_models`/`denied_models` globs, a `confidentiality` tag
  (`public` / `personal` / `client-confidential` / `air-gapped`), and a
  `fallback_behavior` (`DENY` / `DOWNGRADE_TO_LOCAL` / `WARN`). The
  cross-workspace agent runtime enforces the strictest applicable
  policy. Workspaces with no `routing.yaml` default to `personal` with
  no model restrictions, preserving prior behavior.
- **`identity.yaml` is a new convention at `~/.synthesis/`.** Declares
  `personal_workspaces` (the list of workspaces treated as universal
  for skill scoping) and `personal_remote_patterns` (used by the
  synthesis-git-hooks policy to classify a repo as personal vs strict).
  Required for the new workspace-scoped skills discovery to know which
  workspaces are personal vs scoped.
- **Agent loop API signature.** `AgentLoop.run()` accepts new kwargs:
  `workspaces` (list, not single value), `workspace_roots`,
  `routing_enforced`, and `cross_workspace_budget_tokens`. The legacy
  single-workspace shape continues to work — a single-element list
  preserves prior behavior — but consumers calling the agent loop
  directly should update to the multi-workspace shape.

### Migration notes

If you are upgrading from v3.3:

1. **Update imports.** Replace `from ragbot.X` substrate imports with
   `from synthesis_engine.X`. The same applies to `RagbotError` →
   `SynthesisError`.
2. **Create `~/.synthesis/identity.yaml`.** A minimal example:
   ```yaml
   personal_workspaces:
     - acme-user
   personal_remote_patterns:
     - "github.com:acme-user/"
   ```
   The `synthesis-git-hooks` skill in `synthesis-skills` includes a
   commented example config. Install via `npx skills add
   synthesisengineering/synthesis-skills --skill synthesis-git-hooks`.
3. **Add `routing.yaml` to confidential workspaces.** A minimal example
   for a `client-confidential` workspace:
   ```yaml
   confidentiality: client-confidential
   allowed_models:
     - "ollama/*"
     - "ollama_chat/*"
   denied_models:
     - "claude-*"
     - "gpt-*"
     - "gemini-*"
   fallback_behavior: DENY
   ```
4. **Install the synthesis-git-hooks engine.** Replace any repo-local
   `.githooks/pre-commit` with the universal engine at
   `~/.synthesis/git-hooks/` (installed via the synthesis-git-hooks
   skill above). Configure `~/.synthesis/git-hook-config.yaml` with your
   client names, internal URLs, and personal-remote patterns.
5. **Install the anti-shortcut catalog.** `~/.synthesis/anti-shortcut-catalog.yaml`
   is consumed by the synthesis-anti-shortcuts skill and by the
   pre-commit hooks to detect lazy-shortcut costume vocabulary in code
   and prose. Install via `npx skills add
   synthesisengineering/synthesis-skills --skill synthesis-anti-shortcuts`.

### Acknowledgments

Thanks to everyone who reviewed proposals, surfaced issues, and pushed
back on lazy shortcuts during the v3.4 development cycle. The lessons
distilled during development inform the
[synthesis-anti-shortcuts](https://github.com/synthesisengineering/synthesis-skills/tree/main/synthesis-anti-shortcuts)
skill, which any SKILL.md-compatible AI coding agent can install.
